/**
 * The half of the mutex skill that has to be deterministic.
 *
 * An agent can read the CLI's output and reason about it, but three things
 * cannot be left to reasoning:
 *
 * - **The owner has to survive the session.** `unlock` and `renew` only work
 *   when the name matches exactly, so the name used to take a lock is
 *   generated once here and read back from the state file, rather than
 *   retyped from memory three tool calls later.
 * - **Expiry has to be visible without asking.** A lock is a promise with a
 *   deadline. Anything that has to be queried is a deadline nobody sees, so
 *   what was acquired is written to a small local file that a status line or a
 *   hook can read in a millisecond, with no database round trip.
 * - **A lock must not be forgotten.** Wrapping the acquisition is what keeps
 *   the file honest: there is no path where the lock is taken and the record
 *   of it is not.
 *
 * The state file is a cache and never the truth. PostgreSQL holds the locks;
 * losing this file loses the reminder, not the lock, and `mutex status <id>`
 * still names the owner needed to release it.
 */
